# Microsoft Azure Classroom Reference Diagrams

These diagrams aren't the prettiest, and as-is they represent redundant, terrible Azure topologies.

However, for the purpose of demonstrating many Azure products in a confind space, they are great!

I give you permission to use/adapt these diagrams to your heart's content. For attribution, simply link to [**timw.info**](https://timw.info). Thanks! -Tim Warner
